# Spring-Boot-CRUD-REST-API-with-MySQL
-Built a fully functional CRUD REST API using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL, implementing endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user records.
-Handled edge cases like duplicate entries and missing records with proper HTTP status codes and error handling using ResponseEntity.
-Tested APIs using Postman, ensured proper table creation and persistence via JPA, and used layered architecture for clean separation of concerns (Controller, Service, Repository, Entity).
